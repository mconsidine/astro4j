# Welcome to JSol'Ex {{version}}!

Here are the new features in this version:

- [Custom animations and cropping](#custom-animations-and-cropping)
- [Bugfixes and improvements](#bugfixes-and-improvements)

## Custom animations and cropping

It is now possible to crop and image to a manual selection or create animations of a region of a solar disk, or a panel of redshifts, by manually selecting a region of interest.

To do this, in the image view, press "control" then click and drag to select the region of interest.
A menu will appear where you can either select to crop the image to the selection or create an animation/panel of the selected region.

In order for the annotations to be accurate, make sure that:

- you have set the pixel size of your camera in the observation details
- you have either selected "autodetect" in wavelength selection or you have explicitly specified the correct wavelength


## Bugfixes and improvements

- Fixed ringing artifacts in autostretched image
- Fixed a bug preventing negative longitude or latitude coordinates
