# Astro4j

A collection of libraries and applications for astronomy image processing in Java.

The project currently only consists of:

- [jserfile](jserfile/) : a library to read SER video files
- [ser-player](ser-player/) : an application which plays SER files
- [JSol'Ex](jsolex) : an applcation to process [Sol'Ex](http://www.astrosurf.com/solex/) video files

If you want some context about why I started developing this, you can read my [announcement blog post](https://melix.github.io/blog/2023/04-22-introducing-astro4j.html).
